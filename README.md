# Dependencies

Depending on what notebook you would like to run you might slighlty different python packages.

Folder `conda-envs` includes conda environment files to create the correct environment. Each notebook includes instructions on what environment is needed to run it.

Notebook [00-setting-up-python-and-jupyter-with-conda-environments-on-linux-or-mac-osx](./notebooks/00-setting-up-python-and-jupyter-with-conda-environments-on-linux-or-mac-osx.ipynb) includes additional instructions on how to set up python and jupyter on linux and mac os x.


# How to run it

Each notebook stands on its own. This means that you simply need to run each cell in the notebook you would like to run :)
